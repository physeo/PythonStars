# PythonStars

Simple Python demo for printing out stars in different patters

You can run the script by pasting it into an online interpreter like http://pythonfiddle.com/
or, if you download and install python from https://www.python.org/ you can run it on your own computer.

The community edition of PyCharm is the IDE I used in the demo and is a great tool to get you started https://www.python.org/.
